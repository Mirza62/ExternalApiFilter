Create a Web API with the following functionality. 
1. Add an endpoint to get a list of campaigns. 
Make a call to external API https://testapi.donatekart.com/api/campaign to fetch the campaigns and sort them by Total Amount in descending order and return the campaigns. 
The result returned should contain the fields Title, Total Amount, Backers Count and End Date. 


2. Add an endpoint to get active campaigns that are created within the last 1 month. Make a call to external API
https://testapi.donatekart.com/api/campaign to fetch campaigns and filter active campaigns. A campaign is active if the end date is greater than or equal to today. 
Filter the list further to get the campaigns that are created within the last 30 days.

As a young girl, she was always curious about women wearing white sarees and shaved heads. She then learnt about the plight of widows in Vrindavan. Heartbroken and angry, very early on she decided that she wanted to do something for widows.  In order to empower other women, she first needed to empower herself. A gold medalist from Agra University, she went on to obtain a PHD in History and Hindi. She’s currently an associate professor at the Institute of Oriental Philosophy.  Today, Dr Gautam provides for countless abandoned widows through her NGO Kanak Dhara Foundation. The NGO looks after the day to day needs such as food and medicines. Emotional care is also provided because these widows have lived through very traumatic circumstances. Started nine years ago, Dr Gautam looks after the widows on her own without much financial help. Most of the times, she has a few widows staying with her in the house where she takes care of them.   \"These women are abandoned, left to fend for themselves after their husbands are dead. Several die in penury, and young widows are forced into prostitution,\" says Dr Gautam.  Dr.Gautam also looks after the widows who pass away. A normal day for her begins in the alleys besides the ghats of the Yamuna. Her goal is to provide a dignified end to the widows who pass away. Once she finds a dead body, she arranges for a respectable cremation. Logs are arranged and last rites are performed. In 2015, she was awarded Nari Shakti Puraskar by the then President Pranab Mukherji at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.  Despite her best efforts, Dr.Gautam needs your help to be able to provide for these widows. Most of these widows are uneducated or very old. They have been abandoned by their families. Please come forward to donate a few food items and help them live out the rest of their lives in peace.","imageSrc":"https://testimages.donatekart.com/campaign/KDF_New.png","created":"2019-08-21T11:16:08Z","endDate":"2020-12-10T00:00:00Z","totalAmount":187975.00,"procuredAmount":163680.00,"totalProcured":4522.000000,"backersCount":227.0,"categoryId":4,"location":null,"ngoCode":"KDF","ngoName":"Kanak Dhara Foundation","daysLeft":0,"percentage":87.0},{"id":1893,"code":"MHH_FloodsRelief","title":"Save the Flood Victims from Starving.

As a young girl, she was always curious about women wearing white sarees and shaved heads. She then learnt about the plight of widows in Vrindavan. Heartbroken and angry, very early on she decided that she wanted to do something for widows.  In order to empower other women, she first needed to empower herself. A gold medalist from Agra University, she went on to obtain a PHD in History and Hindi. She’s currently an associate professor at the Institute of Oriental Philosophy.  Today, Dr Gautam provides for countless abandoned widows through her NGO Kanak Dhara Foundation. The NGO looks after the day to day needs such as food and medicines. Emotional care is also provided because these widows have lived through very traumatic circumstances. Started nine years ago, Dr Gautam looks after the widows on her own without much financial help. Most of the times, she has a few widows staying with her in the house where she takes care of them.   \"These women are abandoned, left to fend for themselves after their husbands are dead. Several die in penury, and young widows are forced into prostitution,\" says Dr Gautam.  Dr.Gautam also looks after the widows who pass away. A normal day for her begins in the alleys besides the ghats of the Yamuna. Her goal is to provide a dignified end to the widows who pass away. Once she finds a dead body, she arranges for a respectable cremation. Logs are arranged and last rites are performed. In 2015, she was awarded Nari Shakti Puraskar by the then President Pranab Mukherji at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.  Despite her best efforts, Dr.Gautam needs your help to be able to provide for these widows. Most of these widows are uneducated or very old. They have been abandoned by their families. Please come forward to donate a few food items and help them live out the rest of their lives in peace.","imageSrc":"https://testimages.donatekart.com/campaign/KDF_New.png","created":"2019-08-21T11:16:08Z","endDate":"2020-12-10T00:00:00Z","totalAmount":187975.00,"procuredAmount":163680.00,"totalProcured":4522.000000,"backersCount":227.0,"categoryId":4,"location":null,"ngoCode":"KDF","ngoName":"Kanak Dhara Foundation","daysLeft":0,"percentage":87.0},{"id":1893,"code":"MHH_FloodsRelief","title":"Save the Flood Victims from Starving.

As a young girl, she was always curious about women wearing white sarees and shaved heads. She then learnt about the plight of widows in Vrindavan. Heartbroken and angry, very early on she decided that she wanted to do something for widows.  In order to empower other women, she first needed to empower herself. A gold medalist from Agra University, she went on to obtain a PHD in History and Hindi. She’s currently an associate professor at the Institute of Oriental Philosophy.  Today, Dr Gautam provides for countless abandoned widows through her NGO Kanak Dhara Foundation. The NGO looks after the day to day needs such as food and medicines. Emotional care is also provided because these widows have lived through very traumatic circumstances. Started nine years ago, Dr Gautam looks after the widows on her own without much financial help. Most of the times, she has a few widows staying with her in the house where she takes care of them.   \"These women are abandoned, left to fend for themselves after their husbands are dead. Several die in penury, and young widows are forced into prostitution,\" says Dr Gautam.  Dr.Gautam also looks after the widows who pass away. A normal day for her begins in the alleys besides the ghats of the Yamuna. Her goal is to provide a dignified end to the widows who pass away. Once she finds a dead body, she arranges for a respectable cremation. Logs are arranged and last rites are performed. In 2015, she was awarded Nari Shakti Puraskar by the then President Pranab Mukherji at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.  Despite her best efforts, Dr.Gautam needs your help to be able to provide for these widows. Most of these widows are uneducated or very old. They have been abandoned by their families. Please come forward to donate a few food items and help them live out the rest of their lives in peace.","imageSrc":"https://testimages.donatekart.com/campaign/KDF_New.png","created":"2019-08-21T11:16:08Z","endDate":"2020-12-10T00:00:00Z","totalAmount":187975.00,"procuredAmount":163680.00,"totalProcured":4522.000000,"backersCount":227.0,"categoryId":4,"location":null,"ngoCode":"KDF","ngoName":"Kanak Dhara Foundation","daysLeft":0,"percentage":87.0},{"id":1893,"code":"MHH_FloodsRelief","title":"Save the Flood Victims from Starving.
